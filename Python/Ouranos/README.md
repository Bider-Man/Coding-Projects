# Ouranos
## Game Concept
In Greek myth, Ouranos (also known as Uranus) was the personification of the sky. I chose this name because I wanted the game to be thematically mean that I am aiming for something unique and not done by many people. As people say, "The sky is the limit." That is what I wanted to capture within this game.

So, therefore Ouranos is a game about rolling dice and reaching level 20. Inspired by games like Cookie Clicker, Antimatter Dimensions and Pathfinder 2e.

And just like Cookie Clicker and/or Antimatter Dimensions, all you have to do is press "Space" to roll the dice and see your xp go up!

You are also able to forage for ingredients and make potions to help you gain advantages in terms of rolling and there are Astrological events that give you bonuses.

Ideally, there would've been side quests that give you automation processes, by unlocking workers, but I was unable to properly implement them in the time constraint given to us.

## How to Run
This is pretty simple, just copy-paste the code into your IDE of choice, and type in "python ouranos.py" into the terminal (in the same location as to where the file has been saved. So, if it was saved in Downloads, you will need to "cd/home/Downloads/Ouranos/" and then type in "python ouranos.py").

## Features and Classes
Like I mentioned within the Game Concept, the game has an alchemy, astrology and scavenging part. While the astrology section of the code runs on chance, you are able to craft potions and go for scavenging for the raw ingredients required to make the potions.

I don't want to spoil too much on what each of the astrology and alchemy features do, as you can play the game and find out (which is half the fun!).

The classes I implemented for this game are: Player, Alchemy, Astrology, Scavenging and Dice Animator. These classes helped me create a blueprint for all the features I mentioned above and add functions to make the game engaging and playable.
